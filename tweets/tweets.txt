The CDC ???adjusted the US Covid deaths from 153,504 to 9,210.??ÔøΩ
@GracieLuAnn24 @kevinfurr @PeterZeihan @alexismadrigal The whole reason that California switched from people tested to tests performed is that they were having trouble figuring out how to assign tests to patients. So I really doubt we'll ever see those numbers. -@alexismadrigal

With community transmission is it not high time that Favipravir and Fabiflu be prescribed and available as first line of treatment in all suspected cases. This will not only reduce the viral load but go a long way in reducing the case load of Covid centre's and hospitals

@KagAshley @daveman19802 @charliekirk11 Ashley, Hot spots for COVID-19 are also commonly 5G areas! https://t.co/1aTO9qo0HE Fear ignorance as much as fear. A virus is a virus. Also, look at zinc, Vitamins D, C, A &amp; quinine, &amp; last but not least chlorine dioxide. You can a kit for $50, enough for person months.
‚ÄúScientists across the world are working hard to find new therapeutics for #COVID19. We are aware of the new research on Dexamethsaone &amp; will evaluate emerging data on its use to inform our strategy on clinical management of #COVID19 cases‚Äù ~ @Chikwe_I on @cnbcafrica https://t.co/KVcKE20jKK

@RickLeventhal @RepAndyBiggsAZ If covid is so deadly I'm wondering how I did die yet. I work in critical care, we used to intubate patients in surgical masks only, did many aerosolized procedures. I'm perfectly fine not even a runny nose.
‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs not a lack of resources that may lead to inefficiency but inability to connect the dots. To measure efficiency in #COVID19 testing we set a target to test 2000 samples per day in Lagos &amp; 1000 per day in Abuja‚Äù ~ @Chikwe_I on @AIT_Online https://t.co/Qf13DvLUHR
Nigerians are "burning Chinese stores.".
The cloth face coverings recommended to slow spread of #COVID19 are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators. Those critical supplies must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders as recommended by current CDC guidance.
